## Usage

#### Lates & specific date rates
Get the latest foreign exchange rates.

```http
GET /latest
```

Get historical rates for any day since 1999.

```http
GET /2018-03-26
```

Rates are quoted against the Euro by default. Quote against a different currency by setting the base parameter in your request.

```http
GET /latest?base=USD
```

Request specific exchange rates by setting the symbols parameter.

```http
GET /latest?symbols=USD,GBP
```

#### Rates history
Get historical rates for a time period.

```http
GET /history?start_at=2018-01-01&end_at=2018-09-01
```

Limit results to specific exchange rates to save bandwidth with the symbols parameter.

```http
GET /history?start_at=2018-01-01&end_at=2018-09-01&symbols=ILS,JPY
```

Quote the historical rates against a different currency.

```http
GET /history?start_at=2018-01-01&end_at=2018-09-01&base=USD
```

#### Client side usage

The primary use case is client side. For instance, with [money.js](https://openexchangerates.github.io/money.js/) in the browser

```js
let demo = () => {
  let rate = fx(1).from("GBP").to("USD")
  alert("£1 = $" + rate.toFixed(4))
}

fetch('https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest')
  .then((resp) => resp.json())
  .then((data) => fx.rates = data.rates)
  .then(demo)
```

## Deployment
#### Virtualenv
```shell
pipenv shell
```

#### Install packages
```shell
pipenv install
```

#### Load in initial data & Scheduler
The scheduler will keep your database up to date hourly with information from European Central bank. It will download the last 90 days worth of data every hour.

_The reference rates are usually updated around 16:00 CET on every working day, except on TARGET closing days. They are based on a regular daily concertation procedure between central banks across Europe, which normally takes place at 14:15 CET._

On initialization it will check the database. If it's empty all the historic rates will be downloaded and records created in the database.

## Development
```shell
gunicorn exchangerates.app:app --worker-class sanic.worker.GunicornWorker --reload
```
